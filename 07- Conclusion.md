## Next Steps: Where to Go from Here

So, what’s next? The FaceGuard project doesn’t have to end here. Here are some ideas to take it further:

### 1. **Add More Features**
   - **Emotion Detection:** Train your model to recognize facial expressions like happiness or anger.
   - **Multi-User Support:** Allow the system to handle multiple user profiles seamlessly.
   - **2-Factor Authentication:** Combine facial recognition with another method, like a password or a fingerprint.

### 2. **Improve Accuracy**
   - Experiment with pre-trained deep learning models like MTCNN or FaceNet for better precision.
   - Expand your training dataset to include more diverse images.

### 3. **Deploy It!**
   - Turn this into a full-fledged application by integrating it with a web or mobile interface.
   - Host it on a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud to make it accessible anywhere.

### 4. **Dive Deeper into AI and Cybersecurity**
   - Explore other AI-powered security tools, like voice authentication or anomaly detection systems.
   - Read up on adversarial attacks in facial recognition systems and learn how to defend against them.
