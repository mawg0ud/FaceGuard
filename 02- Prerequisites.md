# 02- Prerequisites

Hey there! Before we go into the nitty-gritty of the 'FaceGuard' project, let's make sure we have everything we need to get started.

Think of this as the checklist for our journey a little prep work now will save us from headaches later.

## Skills You Need

Don’t worry; you don’t need to be an expert to follow along, but having a good grasp of the basics will make everything much smoother.

Here’s what you should be comfortable with:

- **Python programming**: If you know how to write loops, functions, and work with libraries, you’re good to go. If not, maybe do a quick Python crash course first.
- **Basic machine learning**: It’s helpful to know what a neural network is and how training works, but we’ll cover the essentials as we go.
- **Command-line basics**: You should be able to navigate folders and run commands in a terminal.
- **Cybersecurity concepts**: Familiarity with authentication methods (passwords, biometrics, etc.) will be useful.

If you’re feeling shaky in any of these areas, no worries! Spend a bit of time brushing up, and you’ll catch up in no time.

## Tools and Software

Now let’s talk about the tools we’ll need. Setting up your environment properly is like having the right gear for a hike—essential!

1. **Python**: Make sure you’ve installed Python 3.8 or later. If you’re not sure how, check out [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Libraries**: We’ll be using some popular Python libraries. Don’t worry; we’ll guide you through installing them later, but here’s the list:
   - OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)
   - NumPy (for data manipulation)
   - TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning models)
3. **IDE or Code Editor**: Use whatever you’re comfortable with, like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
4. **Git**: This will help us manage code and versioning. If you don’t have Git, grab it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
5. **Webcam**: While not mandatory, having a webcam will let you test the project in real time.

## System Requirements

Let’s make sure your computer can handle this project. Here’s what you need:

- **Operating System**: Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Memory**: At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended for smooth performance.
- **Processor**: A modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or better).
- **GPU (optional)**: If you’re using deep learning models, having a GPU (like an NVIDIA card) will speed things up.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Once you’ve got the tools and requirements sorted, you’ll need to set up your development environment. Here’s a quick rundown:

1. **Install Python**: Check if Python is installed by running `python --version` in your terminal. If not, download it from the official site.
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: This keeps your project dependencies separate. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv faceguard_env
   source faceguard_env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: faceguard_env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**: Use `pip` to install the libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow
   ```
4. **Check Your Webcam**: If you’re using one, test it with OpenCV to make sure it’s working.
